# Sequential Structure

You are given a set of input and output and have to design a logic that matches input and output using String.

Instructions:
1. Analyze the input-output relationship for the given example to understand the pattern.
2. Write a Java program to implement the function analysis.
3. Ensure that your program handles possible inputs appropriately.
4. Test your program with different inputs to ensure its correctness.

Note: In the sample input given, the first line represents a String. The last line represents the value of 'k'.
Make sure that output should be displayed in the same format as given in the sample output.

Sample Input:
100 200 300 400 500
10
Sample Output: 
491 390 289 188 87


Sample Input: 
44 55 66 77 88
4
Sample Output: 
85 73 61 49 37
